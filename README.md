Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the solution for the getdata-008 course project, with the following files:

* run_analysis.R script: Code to transform raw data to the tidy dataset specified in the project instructions.
* CodeBook.md: the code book for the resulting dataset, describing the variables, the data and the transformations performed to clean up the data.

Data Sourse
=====================
This project uses the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Instructions
=====================
This script is able to download the data necessary to build tidy data. After completed it will create two files in the working directory, one containing tidy dataset ready for further analysis and a second file with calculated means of all columns of each activity and subject.
